# FUTA Atmospheric Pressure Research

**Description:**  
This project demonstrates atmospheric pressure analysis conducted as part of my research at FUTA. Using ERA5 datasets, the project models surface and upper-air pressure levels with Python.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, ERA5 Dataset

**Folder Structure:**
- `python_scripts/` - pressure_analysis.py: Python analysis script
- `data_samples/` - sample_pressure_data.csv: Sample ERA5 pressure dataset

**Role:** Research Assistant / Data Analyst

**Outcome:**  
- Developed Python scripts for analyzing atmospheric pressure levels  
- Simulated vertical pressure profiles from surface to upper-air levels  
- Generated professional plots to visualize pressure trends  
- Demonstrates ability to apply meteorology and climate science knowledge in coding
